## Pros `r icon::fa_smile()`

- quick, easy to use
- pulls together data, analysis, plots
- good for storing many small datasets
- data validation tools

## Cons `r icon::fa_frown()` 

- unclear chronology
- difficult to separate data, code, output
- easy to make mistakes: overwrite data, faulty formulas, incomplete cells

# Adopt the best practices _moving forward_

# Keep raw data raw

>Always store an uncorrected data file with all its bumps and warts. Do not make any corrections to this file; make corrections within a scripted language. ([Borer et al. 2009](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205))

# Organize data as a single rectangle

Separate tables into different sheets _or_ reorganize your data to fit into one rectangle. All cells in a column should be the same type (text, numeric, etc.)

# Don't repeat yourself (too much)

.pull-left[
If you find yourself copying information a lot, consider reorganizing your data into separate tables (i.e. as a _relational database_).

Single table:

# Create a data dictionary

![](img/data-dict.png)

---

# Missing values

Use `NA`, `NULL`, or even `-` to represent missing values. Avoid numeric values (-999 or 999) and blanks

![](img/blanks-bad.png)

--

_Note:_ `fill()` from the `tidyr` package is a handy function for dealing with blanks in data

## Don't use formatting to store information

.pull-right[
![](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/fig/good_formatting.png)

Add an extra column if you need to!

---
# Enter ONE piece of information per cell

```{r echo = FALSE}
tibble(species_sex = c("AA-F", "AA-M", "AB-M"),
       tail_length = c("4.4 cm", "43 cm - check??", "6.1 cm")) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(dom = 't'))
```

---
# Choose good names

During analysis, some names are easier to deal with than others:

- short but descriptive
- lower case
- no spaces
- no special characters

---
# Choose good names

The `clean_names()` function from the [janitor](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) package will reformat names for you! 

```{r}
tibble(`Field sites!` = c("A", "B", "B"),
       `Max temp (C)` = c(32, 33, 35)) %>%
    janitor::clean_names()
```

# Beware of dates

Excel dates depend on your operating system, Excel version, and locale. (_horror stories: [1](https://uc3.cdlib.org/2014/04/09/abandon-all-hope-ye-who-enter-dates-in-excel/), [2](http://ecologybits.com/index.php/2016/07/06/beware-this-scary-thing-excel-can-do-to-your-data/), [3](https://practicaldatamanagement.wordpress.com/2014/07/02/dealing-with-dates-as-data-in-excel/)_)

![](https://datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/fig/5_excel_dates_1.jpg)

--

Avoid problems by:

- separating dates into month, date, year columns
- storing dates as year, day of year
- storing dates as a single string YYYYMMDD or with underscores YYYY_MM_DD

---
# QA your data

Make a **copy** of your data to avoid messing up your real data

Try the [data validation tool](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/apply-data-validation-to-cells-29fecbcc-d1b9-42c1-9d76-eff3ce5f7249?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fApply-data-validation-to-cells-c743a24a-bc48-41f1-bd92-95b6aeeb73c9&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) in Excel

---
# Make backups

.pull-right[
- _Write-protect_ files once you are done entering in data
- Store copies of data in different locations (cloud, home, lab)
- Keep all versions of data files (unless they can be reproduced with scripts) 
- Use version control
]

---
# Be consistent!

Make it easy for the machine, and the machine will make it easy for you!

# Exercise

Download the Excel file from [this dataset](https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb/blob/master/survey_data_spreadsheet_messy.xls)

- What problems do you see in the dataset?
- How would you wrangle the data?
- Read it into R ([readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)) and see what you can do
