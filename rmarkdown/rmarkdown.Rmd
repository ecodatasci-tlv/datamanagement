- Must be enclosed in `---`
- output section changes based on the type of ducument

```r
---

## __Plain text__

Here you write everything that isn't a code by using markdown related symbols to create headers, bold text , etc.

---
## __Workflow of Rmd file__

<p><img src="https://tinyurl.com/ycgusx7u" width=100%>

You create an Rmd file, then you knit it with knitr package, it is passed to one of the rendering packages like pandoc or LaTex, and the final format is created

---
# __Practice time__

1. Open an Rmd file in the project you created before
2. Choose the type of document you want to create
3. Write some plain text and some analyses in the code chunk
4. Click on the knit botton at the top bar

Congradulations!!! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ ðŸ¥³ You created your first Rmd file!! `r emo::ji("smile")`

## Files for the website

- Has three files: index.html, index.Rmd, and _site.yml
- The ___site.yml__ is where you configure the top bar of your website and how you nevigate through the pages
- The __index.Rmd__ is where you write the content of your website
-The __index.html__ is updated when you render your website and is used to present it

---

## The YAML header used for it

Here is an example from the website used in our last session
```r

title: "Visualizations in R"

    collapsed: true
    smooth_scroll: true
    toc_depth: 3
    runtime: shiny_prerendered
    # number_sections: true
